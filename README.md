# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As a Full Stack Software Engineer with a penchant for the philosophical and historical gears that drive our world, I find joy in the narratives of theology and the art of storytelling, whether behind the wheel of a car or leading a band of adventurers in Dungeons & Dragons. Iâ€™m fueled by a passion for the open road and the complex tales it unfolds, mirroring the layered quests of coding and the thoughtful design behind every successful campaign. My love for exploring the depths of narrative entertainment and the nuances of theology serves as a compass for creating immersive, meaningful user experiences in the digital realm.
